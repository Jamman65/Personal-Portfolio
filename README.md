# Personal Project (Knights & Nightmares)
Welcome to my Personal project where I have challenged myself to develop a recreation of Dark Souls using all of the skills that I have gained throughout my university course and my own experience such as:

* Reactive AI Systems (State Machines)

* Combat Systems

* Inventory System

* HUD

* Weapons with multiple attack styles and fully equipped with animations to match the specific weapon

* Fully animated player and enemy models

* Equipment with defence bonuses

* Challenging gameplay for each player

* Levelling Up System to increase player stats

* Challenging Boss battle with two phases
